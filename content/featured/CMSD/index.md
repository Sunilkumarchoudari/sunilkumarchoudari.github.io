The project is a web-app designed for Lecturer who want to create assignment or project for their students. Function - Create and manage their project and assign them to students. Future scope - The bigger picture of this web app is to allow any teacher to give his/her class at home. Moreover, this project remains scalable and can be used as a project management system

Technology stack:

HTML 5, CSS 3 (Plain no framework) - it gives me more control over the design of my app
Javascript (Jquery & Ajax) - I choose Ajax to use the request handling to the server, which allows us to have instant update on the front-end, without having any page refresh.
Python (Django) - Django is bulked up with various features that allow us to focus more on the business logic of the app and less database handling, thanks to ORM
SQL (sqlite3) - Very useful at development stage.
Main features

Enhanced user experience, thanks to its design and ease of use
No page refresh and fully dynamic (thanks to XML Request).
