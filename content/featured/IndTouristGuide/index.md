India major tourist destination which pulls thousands of tourists every year. it is a  beautiful place There are a number of monuments and landmarks depicting the cultural, history and development of India. Due to high inflow of domestic as well as international tourists, the manpower required to guide the tourist on these landmark is not sufficient and sometimes lack in the information that need to be given and highlighted to the tourist. Hence we propose the problem of developing a web application which renders information about the monument or landmark just by taking their live pictures as inputs. In other word, the application should allow the user to click a photograph and based on the picture it should display information about the monument/landmark. The application should also notify the user about such monuments/landmarks in the vicinity. The app should also allow the user to give their inputs about the object and also add to knowledge creation about the monuments/landmark. The app should also be able to keep statics about the number of users referring to the monument/landmark along with details of the users.
