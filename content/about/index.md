Hello! I'm Sunil Kumar Choudari, from Hyderabad, India.

My interest in web development started back in 2018 when I decided to try editing custom open source themes â€” turns out hacking together an Hover button taught me a lot about HTML & CSS!

Fast-forward to today, and I've had the privilege of working at an press agency, a start-up, a huge corporation, and a publishing house. My main focus these days is building accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences for a variety of clients.

I enjoy creating things that live on the internet as well worked as Technical writer & Ethical Hacker for various web platforms. and well-versed at blogging since 2017
